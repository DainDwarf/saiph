Fetch code:
-----------
Given that you're reading this document there's a fair chance you've already
downloaded the code, but nevertheless, fetch it with Git here:
git clone http://projects.exent.net/saiph.git

Also, there are several people working on saiph, you might want to add their
repositories too:
  Vidar Wahlberg: git://github.com/canidae/saiph.git
Adrien Panhaleux: git://github.com/DainDwarf/saiph.git
      Kenny Root: git://github.com/kruton/saiph.git
 Jeffrey Bosboom: git://github.com/DrSunglasses/saiph.git

You should add these to git using the following command:
 git remote add -f <nick> <url>
Example:
 git remote add -f canidae git://github.com/canidae/saiph.git

Then you can pull from the different repos with this command:
 git pull <nick> master
Example:
 git pull canidae master


Fetching changes from branches:
-------------------------------
This is probably wrong & outdated. Fix it if you can.

Merge and accept everything:
 git pull <branch> master
Example:
 git pull canidae master

Cherry-pick commits:
 git fetch <branch>
 git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
 git cherry-pick <commit>
Example:
 git fetch canidae
 git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
 git cherry-pick cf90ae9159759317d7721ca804cb091e90baa478


Building & running:
-------------------
Depending on whether you wish to run remotely or locally, edit Saiph.cpp and
change between CONNECTION_TELNET and CONNECTION_LOCAL in
"Saiph *saiph = new Saiph(CONNECTION_TELNET);" (near the bottom of the file).

If you're running locally you'll have to do this once before executing saiph:
 export NETHACKOPTIONS=@<path to nethackrc>

Then build & start the bot:
 make clean && make
 ./saiph

Optionally start the game this way:
 make game
