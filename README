About:
------
saiph - [Stupid|Silly|Smart|Superior]* AI Playing netHack.
* use a descriptive word beginning with "S".

The project is GPLv2 licensed.


Fetch code:
-----------
Given that you're reading this document there's a fair chance you've already
downloaded the code, but nevertheless, fetch it with Git here:
git clone http://projects.exent.net/saiph.git

Also, there are several people working on saiph, you might want to add their
repositories too:
  Vidar Wahlberg: git://github.com/canidae/saiph.git
Adrien Panhaleux: git://github.com/DainDwarf/saiph.git
      Kenny Root: git://github.com/kruton/saiph.git
 Jeffrey Bosboom: git://github.com/DrSunglasses/saiph.git

You should add these to git using the following command:
 git remote add -f <nick> <url>
Example:
 git remote add -f canidae git://github.com/canidae/saiph.git


Keeping your repo updated:
--------------------------
You should pull regularly from http://projects.exent.net/saiph.git or
git://github.com/canidae/saiph.git with this command:
 git pull canidae master
Replace "canidae" if you used another name for that repo.

If some of the other repos got a patch you really want that hasn't been merged
into the main repos, then you can get that patch with the following commands:
 git fetch <nick>
 git log HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
 git show <commit>
 git cherry-pick <commit>


Building & running:
-------------------
If you're running locally you'll have to do this once before executing saiph:
 export NETHACKOPTIONS=@<path to nethackrc>

If you are running on a public server, you will need to create a file named
".account" in the directory where you run saiph; it must have three lines,
consisting of the host name, the dgamelaunch user name, and the password,
like so:

nethack.alt.org
saiph
<omitted>

Furthermore, you will need to pass the -t option to saiph when running.

Connecting to non-dgamelaunch-based servers, such as the ones that run the
/dev/null tournament, will not work.  Patches welcome.

You'll also need a terminal that's capable of displaying at least 160x50
characters.

Then build & start the bot:
 make clean && make
 ./saiph

Optionally start the game this way:
 make game
