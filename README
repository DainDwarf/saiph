Fetch code:
-----------
Given that you're reading this document there's a fair chance you've already
downloaded the code, but nevertheless, fetch it from Git here:
git clone http://exent.net/~canidae/saiph/.git


Building & running:
-------------------
Depending on whether you wish to run remotely or locally, edit Saiph.cpp and
change between CONNECTION_TELNET and CONNECTION_LOCAL in
"Saiph *saiph = new Saiph(CONNECTION_TELNET);" (near the bottom of the file).

If you're running locally you'll have to do this once before executing saiph:
 export NETHACKOPTIONS=@<path to nethackrc>

Then build & start the bot:
 make clean && make
 ./saiph

Optionally start the game this way:
 make game
